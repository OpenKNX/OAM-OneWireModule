We have 8 groups, each group is of type OR (0) or AND (1) group as bitmask i.e. 01000101
Each iButton belongs to any of these groups as bitmask i.e. 11000111
Each iButton is present (1) or absent (0)
Each group-KO is currently on (1) or off (0)

We start an iteration over all iButtons with some bitmasks:
ToProcess:      11111111
GroupType:      01000101

iteration 1:
iButton is 1
iButtonGroups:  11000111
& ToProcess:    11111111
=iButtonGroups: 11000111
groupinteration 0:
                11000111
                       ^ ibutton belongs to this group and must be processed
                         ibutton is 1 and it is an AND group => do nothing
groupinteration 1:
                11000111
                      ^  ibutton belongs to this group and must be processed
                         ibutton is 1 and it is an OR group => Set group-KO to 1 if not already the case
                11111101 ToProcess clears this bit as processed
groupinteration 2:
                11000111

                         ibutton is 1 and it is an AND group => do nothing

                         ibutton is 1 and it is an OR group => Set group-KO to 1 if not already the case
                01111101 ToProcess clears this bit as processed

iteration 2:
iButton is 0:
iButtonGroups:  10100011
& ToProcess:    01111101
=iButtonGroups: 00100001

                         ibutton is 0 and it is an AND group => Set group-KO to 0 if not already the case
                01111100 ToProcess clears this bit as processed
groupinteration 5:
                00100001
                  ^      ibutton belongs to this group and must be processed
                         ibutton is 0 and it is an OR group => do nothing

iButton iterations are over
Final iteration on all groups over ToProcess:
groupinteration 0:
                01111100 
                       ^ group was processed, do nothing
groupinteration 1:
                01111100 
                      ^  group was processed, do nothing
groupinteration 2:
                01111100 
                     ^   group is unprocessed, we check groups type
                01000101 is AND group => set group KO to 1 if not already the case
groupinteration 3:
                01111100 
                    ^    group is unprocessed, we check groups type
                01000101 is OR group => set group KO to 0 if not already the case
